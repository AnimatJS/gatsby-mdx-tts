# Plugin configuration

## AWS credentials

There are two ways to configure your AWS credentials:

1. _(recommended)_ The recommended way is to [create a shared credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/create-shared-credentials-file.html).
2. To override the credentials defined in a shared credentials file or to easily build on a CI environment you can optionally pass in the AWS credentials using plugin configuration options:

```json
{
  "resolve": "gatsby-mdx-tts",
  "options": {
    "awsCredentials": {
      "accessKeyId": process.env.GATSBY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
      "secretAccessKey": process.env.GATSBY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    }
  }
}
```

**Attention:** If you choose to go with option 2 it is highliy recommended to work with [environment variables](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/environment-variables/) (as seen in the example above)! Do not directly paste your AWS credentials into your `gatsby-config.js` file and commit it to git as this would be a security issue!

## AWS region

The AWS region where you want to use AWS Polly has to be configured in the plugin options like for example:

```json
{
  "resolve": "gatsby-mdx-tts",
  "options": {
    "awsRegion": "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

## AWS Polly configurations

The following plugin options are used to modify the speech output generated by AWS Polly:

| Option            | Required | Example                                               |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultVoiceId`  | Yes      | `"Justin"`                                            |
| `lexiconNames`    | No       | `["LexA", "LexB"]`                                    |
| `defaultSsmlTags` | No       | `"<prosody rate='70%'>$SPEECH_OUTPUT_TEXT</prosody>"` |

### About the SSML Tags

- For an overview of all supported SSML tags check out the [supported SSML tags list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html) in the AWS docs.
- The surrounding `<speak>` tag is added automatically.
- The variable `$SPEECH_OUTPUT_TEXT` will be replaced with the speech output text.
